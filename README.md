Note-Taking App
The Note-Taking App is a web application that allows users to create and manage notes efficiently. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for taking notes, and the data is stored using the browser's local storage feature.

Features
Create new notes: Users can easily create new notes by typing in the provided text field.
Save and display notes: The app automatically saves the notes and displays them in a list format for easy navigation.
Edit and delete notes: Users have the ability to edit or delete existing notes as needed.
Local storage: The note data is stored locally on the user's device using the browser's local storage feature, ensuring that the notes are preserved even when the app is closed or refreshed.
Usage
To use the Note-Taking App, follow these steps:

Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
The app interface will be displayed, showing any previously saved notes (if any).
To create a new note, simply type in the text field provided and press enter or click the save button.
The note will be saved and displayed in the list of notes.
To edit or delete a note, click on the corresponding note in the list and make the necessary changes or use the delete option.
